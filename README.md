# LU-Rando

Steps to use:
1. Put the "CDServer.sqlite" in the "\Application_Files\DataBase" folder.
2. Choose your options in "Options.txt"
3. Run "LURando.exe" and wait for it to close itself out.
4. Replace the "CDServer.sqlite" in your server with the one in the "\Application_Files\DataBase" folder. (It has been modified)
5. Convert the same "CDServer.sqlite" using https://fdb.lu-dev.net/sqlite-to-fdb/ and replace the "cdclient.fdb" with the resulting file. (Make sure to rename the resulting file to "cdclient.fdb")
6. Run the server and client and connect to the server.
7. Have fun!
